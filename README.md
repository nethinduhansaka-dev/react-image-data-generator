# react-image-data-generator


```markdown

A Python script to automate the creation of a React-compatible array of image data from images stored in a specific folder. This can be useful for dynamically managing and displaying images in a React project, with details such as the file name, modification date, and folder name prepared in a structured format.

## Features
- Scans a specified folder for image files with common extensions (`.png`, `.jpg`, `.jpeg`, `.bmp`, `.gif`, `.tiff`, `.webp`).
- Generates an array of objects containing image data fields, ready to use in React.
- Includes error handling to manage issues like missing files or folder access permissions.

## Script Details

### Main Activity
The primary activity of this script is to **prepare a React array using images from a specified folder**. It retrieves each image's filename, modification date, and other metadata to format it into an array of objects. Each object has fields such as:
  - **src**: Path to the image file
  - **alt**: Alternative text, using the folder name
  - **title**: Image title, using the folder name
  - **description**: Description, using the folder name
  - **date**: File modification date
  - **category**: Image category, using the folder name
  
This output is written to a text file in a format suitable for direct use in React components.

### Secondary Event: Error Handling
The function includes an error-handling mechanism that catches and prints any exceptions that occur during file operations. This ensures stability by handling potential errors such as missing files or permission issues when accessing directories.

## Usage

1. **Set the Folder Path and Output File Path:**
   Update the `folder_path` and `output_file` variables with your image folder path and desired output file location.

2. **Run the Script:**
   Execute the script to generate the React array.

3. **Output:**
   The output file will contain an array of image objects formatted for easy integration into a React project.

### Example Usage
```python
# Replace with your folder path and output file name
folder_path = r'C:\path\to\your\image\folder'
output_file = r'C:\path\to\your\output\file.txt'

write_image_names_to_file(folder_path, output_file)
```

## Sample Output

An example of the output array format:
```javascript
{ 
  src: "storage/images/events/folder_name/image_name.jpg", 
  alt: "folder_name", 
  title: "folder_name", 
  description: "folder_name", 
  date: "YYYY-MM-DD", 
  category: "folder_name" 
},
```

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- Required permissions to read from the specified folder and write to the output file.

## Error Handling
If an error occurs, the script will output a descriptive message, ensuring smooth operation even when issues arise.
